NEW: Attention we use json with our new framework and do just a couple of actions in mysql now.

We use PHPMYADMIN all queries would be shown after the changes.

Just copy and past ur sql queries into .sql files with useful names.

Versions, every versions have their own required queries, which must be import in PHPMYADMIN.
